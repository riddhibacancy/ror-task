1) strptime VS strftime
	
	# strptime
		-Parses the given representation of date and time with the 
		 given template, and creates a DateTime object. strptime 
		 does not support specification of flags and width unlike strftime.
		
		-strptime is short for "parse time" 
			
		-format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S"
		 date_time = "21/03/2011 16:39:11.642"
		 puts DateTime.strptime(date_time, format)
	#strftime
		-Formats date according to the directives in the given
		 format string. The directives begin with a percent (%) character.
		 Any text not listed as a directive will be passed through to
		 the output string.	
		
	

2) loop vs itrator
	#loop
		-it is too easy to break your program by 
		 producing a so called infinite loop, if you fail to ensure 
		 that the termination condition really occurs
	#itrator
		-it don`t go into infinite
		- you can define custom iterators for your special looping needs 
		
		# loop               vs.           iterator

		i = 0                              5.times do
		while i < 5                         
		  puts "hello"                       puts "hello"
		  i += 1
		end                                end
